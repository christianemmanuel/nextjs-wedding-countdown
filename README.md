## Description

This application is designed to count down the days until a specified date, in this case, a wedding day. It dynamically calculates and displays the number of days remaining, updating every second to ensure accuracy.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm install

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Run unit test command

```bash
npm test
